## Overview

This is a library for sending and receiving DMX codes using the Arduino plattform or a ATmega (ATmega168, ATmega328 or similar) processor with a clock speed of 16 MHz. 
You can implement DMX devices and DMX controller with this library.

The DMXSerialClass class implemets all the functionality.

You can find more detail on this library at http://www.mathertel.de/Arduino/DMXSerial.aspx.

## Supported Hardware

A suitable hardware is the Arduino platform plus a shield for the DMX physical protocol implementation.
You can find such a shield at: http://www.mathertel.de/Arduino/DMXShield.aspx.

Without or some modification this library can also used with other DMX shields
that use the Serial port for connectting to the DMX bus.
